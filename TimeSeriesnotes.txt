6.1) Time Series decomposition.

Mutiplicative decomposition common with economic time series.

The trend-cycle shows the overall movement in the series, ignoring 
the seasonality and any small random fluctuations.

Deseasonalization of data, when do we use deseasonalized data:

Not smooth and downturn and upturn can be misleading.


If the purpose is to look at downturn or upturns then use trend-cycle 
component rather than seasonally adjusted data.


6.2) Moving Averages
